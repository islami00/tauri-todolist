# Todo

* Figure out reasonable keys for the todolist, todos, and labels, and use these in forming the relations. (Complete your schema and model!!). Update in [dataModel](./src/modules/Todo/README.md#data-model)
* Start from the [TodoPageEntry](./src/pages/Todo/TodoPageEntry.tsx) and fetch the todo based on what was passed
* Serialise todos to a regular object (Not array) with todo keys on one side, and the todo objects on the other side and pass to page.
* Update props on page to follow our passing a k-v map instead of an array
* Add more todos when you return as fit...
