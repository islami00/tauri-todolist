### Tauri TodoList 

> Techstack: Vite + React + Tauri + XState + Mantine

Hi there! , welcome to my grand experiment with all five of those technologies. The aim here is to build a todolist using the tauri stack, and through that, get acquainted with Xstate, and mantine.

You can get started in dev with: `yarn run dev`
Run both UI and the app backend with: `yarn run tauri dev`
Or Compile App alone with: `cd src-tauri && cargo build --no-default-features`
And run the app with: `./src-tauri/target/debug/app`

Let's have fun!
